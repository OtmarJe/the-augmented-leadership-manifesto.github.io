# How to contribute

The contents of the Augmented Leadership Manifesto, i.e., the statement and the 12 principles, are not set in stone.
Instead, they are an invitation for optimization.
However, this optimization will be curated.
We, the authors of the Manifesto, will carefully read the comments on your pull request.
After review, the content you have changed will be lifted to the respective page or pages.
Or not if we believe that they do not represent an improvement.
But all this will be open for discussion.

These are the steps to contribute:

- Step 1: **Browse** to the [repository](https://github.com/the-augmented-leadership-manifesto/the-augmented-leadership-manifesto.github.io/tree/main/content) of the manifesto.
- Step 2: Make sure that you are **signed in** to GitHub.
- Step 3: **Click** the file you want to improve.
- Step 4: Hit the edit button (with the **pencil**) top right of the file content.
- Step 5: **Change the content to your liking.**
- Step 6: Hit the commit button (at the bottom)
- Step 7: **Fire a pull request**. In the pull request, describe **the reason** for the changes you made.
