## Welcome!

Our Augmented Leadership Manifesto and its 12 principles culminate with years of experience in businesses and organizations.
They represent best practices based on current knowledge.

While some principles may diverge from mainstream thinking, we welcome discussion and strive for constant improvement.
To that end, we invite you to contribute by forking our GitHub repository, making necessary improvements, and submitting a pull request.

Let's start the conversation! Join us in shaping the future of leadership.
