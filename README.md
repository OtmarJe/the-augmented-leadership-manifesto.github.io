# The Augmented Leadership Manifesto

### Augmented Leadership has been developed as a framework for governance and decision-making.

**The Manifesto forms the backbone.**

We, Robert ([Rosho](https://github.com/roshoworld)) Hopp and Otmar ([OJ](https://github.com/OtmarJe)) Jenner, supported by Alexander ([basejumpa](https://github.com/basejumpa)) Mann-Wahrenberg, wish this project to develop further as open source.
We are convinced of the power of swarm intelligence and therefore want this Manifesto to get its wings.
Hence our request: Get involved.
Fork the repository, make improvements, and send us your pull request.
All texts are invitations for optimization.
Their order should remain the same.
The graphics could not be changed.
This site is a mirror of the content of [rosho.world](https://rosho.world/en/manifesto/the-augmented-leadership-manifesto), which we will adjust if necessary.
Thank you for your interest and participation!
